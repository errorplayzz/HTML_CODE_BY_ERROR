    <h1>C Progarmming</h1>
    <h3>What is C?</h3>
    <p>
It is a very powerful and general-purpose language used in programming. We can use C to develop software such as databases, operating systems, compilers, and many more. This programming language is excellent to learn for beginners in programming.</p>
<h3>About C Programming</h3>
<p>
    The C language is imperative, procedural, and general-purpose in nature, developed by Dennis M. Ritchie in 1972 at the Bell Telephone for developing the UNIX OS. As of now, the C language is one of the most widely used computer languages along with Java, which is mostly used among modern programmers.</p>
    <h3>Prerequisites of using the C Language</h3>
    <p>Before you proceed ahead with the understanding and learning of the C language, you must have a basic grasp of the terminologies of computer programming. If you understand the basics of any computer programming language, then you will be able to effectively understand the C language.</p>
    <h3>Why Learn C Programming Language?</h3>
    <p>This language is a must for those working professionals as well as students who want to become established software engineers. Here are some of the key reasons why you must learn the C language for the domain of software development:</p>

        <ul><li>This language helps users comprehend a computer’s internal architecture. It assists you in knowing how a computer would store information within and retrieve it.</li>
        <li>Learning other programming languages becomes easier after learning C, such as Python, Java, etc.</li>
        <li>A programmer who is well-versed with the C language gets opportunities to work on various open-source projects. For instance, some of the very popular projects (open-source) have been written using the C programming language, such as Python interpreter, Linux kernel, SQLite database, and many more.</li></ul>
        <h3>Benefits of C Programming Language</h3>
        <p>Here are a few reasons why programmers choose the C language for running a program:</p>

            <ul><li>It is a structured language.</li>
            <li>The C language is very easy to understand and learn.</li>
            <li>The C language generates very efficient programs.</li>
            <li>It helps you handle various low-level activities.</li>
            <li>The compilation of C programs can occur on various computer programs.</li></ul>

            <h3>Facts About the C Language</h3>
            <ul><li>The C language came into existence for writing an OS known as the UNIX operating system.</li>
                <li>This language is the successor of the B language, which came into existence in the early 1970s.</li>
                <li>The ANSI (American National Standard Institute) formalized this language in 1988.</li>
                <li>The creators of this language have totally written the UNIX OS in C.</li>
                <li>As of today, the C language is the most popular and widely used 
                <li>programming language.</li>
                Programmers have implemented a majority of the futuristic, avant-garde tools and software using the C language.</li></ul>

                <h3>Writing the word “How are you” using a C Program</h3>
                <p>Excited about learning the basics of the C language? Well, you should be. Take a look at a small conventional program written in the C language that prints the phrase, “How are you” in the output.

                    #include <stdio.h>
                    
                    int main() {
                    
                    /* your first programming in C language */
                    
                    printf(“How are you \n”);
                    
                    return 0;
                    
                    }</p>

                    <h3>Applications of a C Program</h3>
                    <p>This language was initially utilized for the development of systems- particularly those programs that would make up an OS (operating system). The C programming language was adopted in the form of a language for system development since it generates codes that run as fast as those codes that exist in the assembly language. Here are a few examples of how we can use the C language in development:</p>

                        <ul><li>Language Compilers</li>
                        <li>Operating Systems</li>
                    <li>ext Editors</li>
                        <li>Assemblers</li>
                        <li>Network Drivers</li>
                    <li>Print Spoolers</li>
                        <li>Modern Programs</li>
                        <li>Language Interpreters</li>
                        <li>Databases</li>
                        <li>Utilities</li></ul>
                        
                        <h3>Uses of the C Programming Language</h3>
                        <ul><li><b>Procedural Language:</b> The execution of the instructions present in a C program happens step by step.</li>
                        <li><b>Speed:</b> The C language is much faster as compared to a majority of the programming languages, such as Python, Java, and many more.</li>
                    <li><b>Portable:</b>
                 A C program can be moved from any given platform to another one, and we can also run it on that platform without any of the charges.</li>
                <li><b>General Purposes:</b> We can use the C programming language for developing operating systems, databases, embedded systems, etc.</li></ul>
