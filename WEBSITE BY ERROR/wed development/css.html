    <h3>What is CSS ?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</li>
        <li>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <li>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Why Use CSS?</h3>
    <p>CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.</p>

<h3>CSS Syntax</h3>
<p>The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
<br><br>
    The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
    <br>
    <br>
    Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
    <br><br>
    Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.</p>

    <h3>CSS Selectors</h3>
    <p>CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.</p>
       <p> We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)</li>
        <li>Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)</li>
        <li>Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)</li>
        <li>Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)</li>
        <li>Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>How To Add CSS</h3>
       <p>There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:</p>
       <ul><li>External CSS</li>
    <li>Internal CSS</li>
<li>Inline CSS</li></ul>

<h4>External CSS</h4>
<p>With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

</p>
<p>Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.</p>

<h4>Internal CSS</h4>
<p>An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.</p>
<p>The internal style is defined inside the style element, inside the head section.</p>

<h4>Inline CSS</h4>
<p>An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.</p>
<p>To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.</p>

<h3>CSS Comments</h3>
<p>Comments are used to explain the code, and may help when you edit the source code at a later date.</p>
<p>Comments are ignored by browsers.</p>
