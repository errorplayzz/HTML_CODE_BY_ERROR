    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <ul><li>Javascript is a scripting language (doh!)</li>
    <li>Dominant for client-side web programming</li>
    <li>Dominant for client-side web programming</li>
    <li>All modern browsers come with a javascript
        engine
        </li>
        <li>Javascript is (generally) an interpreted
            language: the user is given the source code</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Relationship with other languages</h2>
    <ul><li>
        Javascript is not really related to Java.
        
<li>Javascript is more functiona
    
<li>Javascript is relaxed with types</li>
<li> Javascript is relaxed with objects</li></ul>
<h2>Up and running</h2>
<p>Basic way to run a javascript program</p>
<h2>Strings</h2>
<pre><p>Once you have done that, open the types.html page in a browser and take a look at the console to test if you get a "it works" message.

    Strings are used for holding text. There are three different ways to create strings in JavaScript:</p></pre>
    <ol>
        <li>Single Quotes 'text'</li>
        <li>Double Quotes "text"</li>
        <li>Backticks `text`</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>JavaScript Comments</h2>
    <pre>This is a different kind of comment than this style //comment which Wes' has already showed us. The two forward slashes comments out the entire line. You can also put a double slash comment at the end of a line.

        A /* comment will open up what is called a block comment. You can close the block comment anywhere you wish to close it (it can be multiple lines or only a single line).
        
        To disable ESLint for the file, we will use a block comment even though the comment only spans one line, because that is what ESLint is looking for.
    </pre>
    <h2>Difference between Single Quotes, Double Quotes and Backticks</h2>
    <pre>What is the difference between single quotes, double quotes and backticks?

        Single quotes and double quotes are exactly the same thing.
        
        The only reason that we have them both is because if you had a sentence like const sentence = 'she's so cool';, it would break your JavaScript because the JavaScript interprets the apostrophe as closing the string.
        
        If you were to make that change, save the file and then refresh type.html, you will see an error that says</pre>
