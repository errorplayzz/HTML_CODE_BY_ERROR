        <h4><u>Introduction to Python and installation:</u></h4>
        <pre><u>Python</u> is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was initially
            designed by <b>Guido van Rossum in 1991</b> and developed by Python Software Foundation. It
            was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers
            to express concepts in fewer lines of code.
            Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more
            efficiently.

            There are two major Python versions- <b>Python 2</b> and <b>Python 3</b>.</pre>
            <ul>
                <li>On 16 October 2000, Python 2.0 was released with many new features</li>
                <li>On 3rd December 2008, Python 3.0 was released with more testing and includes new
                    features</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Beginning with Python programming:</h4>
            <pre>
                1) Finding an Interpreter:
Before we start Python programming, we need to have an interpreter to interpret and run our
programs. There are certain online interpreters like <b>https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/</b>,
http://ideone.com/ or http://codepad.org/ that can be used to start Python without installing
an interpreter.
Windows: There are many interpreters available freely to run Python scripts like IDLE
(Integrated Development Environment) which is installed when you install the python
software from  <u><b>http://python.org/downloads</b></u>
